- Removed testing merchant stock
- Updated API for how restocking works:
Now, StockedShop::SetupStock is explicitly called once, like ModNPC::ModifyNPCLoot. 
StockedShop::RestockShop is now called every restock, including the first one.
- Added ShopItem::FromModItem methods for easier ShopItem creation.
- Fixed inaccurate XML doc on ShopItem.
